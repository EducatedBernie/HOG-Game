# HOG-Game

In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to reach 100 points first. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. She scores the sum of the dice outcomes, unless any of the dice come up a 1 (Pig out), in which case she scores only 1 point for the turn.
